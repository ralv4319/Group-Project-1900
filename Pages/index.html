      Pop music is a genre of music characterized by its broad mainstream appeal, catchy melodies, and simple, repetitive structures that
      are easy to remember and sing along to. It is often short in length, with a focus on hooks and choruses, and is designed
      to be commercially successful and widely accessible. Pop music is versatile and can incorporate elements from other
      genres, constantly evolving to reflect current trends
